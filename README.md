Lab Assignments: Following is list of suggested laboratory assignments for reference. Laboratory
Instructors may design a suitable set of assignments for their respective course at their level. Beyond
curriculum assignments and mini-project may be included as a part of laboratory work. The instructor
may set multiple sets of assignments and distribute among batches of students. It is appreciated if the
assignments are based on real world problems/applications. The Inclusion of a few optional
assignments that are intricate and/or beyond the scope of curriculum will surely be the value addition
for the students and it will satisfy the intellectuals within the group of the learners and will add to the
perspective of the learners. For each laboratory assignment, it is essential for students to
draw/write/generate flowchart, algorithm, test cases, mathematical model, Test data set and
comparative/complexity analysis (as applicable). Batch size for practical and tutorial may be as per
guidelines of authority.
